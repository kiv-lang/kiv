//! Runtime library for the Kiv programming language.
//!
//! This crate provides the runtime support needed by compiled Kiv programs,
//! including memory management (reference counting), the Text type (CoW strings),
//! and built-in functions.
//!
//! The runtime is designed to be linked with generated code and provides
//! C-compatible ABI for interoperability.
